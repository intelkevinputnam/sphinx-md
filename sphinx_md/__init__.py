# This section determines the behavior of links to local items in .md files.
#
#  if useGitHubURL == True:
#
#     links to local files and directories will be turned into github URLs
#     using either the baseBranch defined here or using the commit SHA.
#
#  if useGitHubURL == False:
#
#     local files will be moved to the website directory structure when built
#     local directories will still be links to github URLs
#
#  if built with GitHub workflows:
#
#     the GitHub URLs will use the commit SHA (GITHUB_SHA environment variable
#     is defined by GitHub workflows) to link to the specific commit.

#  This section defines callbacks that make markdown specific tweaks to
#  either:
#
#  1. Fix something that recommonmark does wrong.
#  2. Provide support for .md files that are written as READMEs in a GitHub
#     repo.
#
#  Only use these changes if using the extension ``recommonmark``.
